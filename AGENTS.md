## Continuous TODO, Work Log, and History Coverage

Maintain `TODO.md` as the active backlog and `TODO_LOG.md` as the searchable
record of closed work. Use `TODO_HISTORY_INDEX.jsonl`, when present, to avoid
parsing unchanged conversations more than once.

- Read `TODO.md` at the beginning and end of related work. Search `TODO_LOG.md`
  before reopening an old task or repeating a previous solution.
- Record actionable bugs, risks, blockers, deferred work, missing tests,
  validation, documentation, and product improvements as they are discovered.
- Update an existing entry instead of creating a duplicate. Keep entries concise
  and under the most relevant category.
- Use `[ ]` pending, `[~]` partial or unverified, `[!]` blocked, `[x]` verified
  complete, `[-]` obsolete or superseded. Keep blockers in `TODO.md` and name
  the smallest action required to unblock them.
- When work becomes `[x]` or `[-]`, remove it from `TODO.md` and add a dated
  entry to `TODO_LOG.md` under `## YYYY` and `### YYYY-MM` headings, in the
  shape below. An `[x]` entry needs an `Evidence:` line and a `[-]` entry a
  `Resolution:` line, each with content.
- Before reviewing past conversations, consult the history index and skip
  unchanged records already marked `complete` or `irrelevant`. Update a record
  only after its findings are reconciled; interrupted work stays `partial`.
- Do not interrupt the active task for unrelated non-critical work, and do not
  implement unrelated TODO items unless requested. Immediately report critical
  security, destructive, or data-loss findings.

```md
- [x] YYYY-MM-DD — **Category:** What was done.
  - Result: What changed.
  - Evidence: The test, command result, commit or PR that proves it.

- [-] YYYY-MM-DD — **Category:** What was dropped.
  - Resolution: Why it no longer applies, or what replaced it.
```
